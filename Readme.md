In this part, I developed a simple backend for a phonebook application using Node.js and Express.js.The backend provides REST endpoints and serves the React frontend I developed in [part 2](../part_2/phonebook/). You can access my phonebook application [here](https://phonebook-backend-omlu.onrender.com).
